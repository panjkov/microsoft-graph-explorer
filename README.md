# Microsoft Graph Explorer
The [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) lets developers quickly navigate and test API endpoints.

The Graph Explorer is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and powered by:
* [Angular 4](https://angular.io/)
* [Office Fabric](https://dev.office.com/fabric)
* [Microsoft Web Framework](https://getmwf.com/)

## Running the explorer locally

* `npm install` to install project dependencies. `npm` is installed by default with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* `bower install`
* `npm start` starts the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and the local server. It should open your browser automatically with the Graph Explorer at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).


#### Enabling authentication with your own credentials
* You'll need to register an app on [apps.dev.microsoft.com](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com) to configure the login page for your local Graph Explorer.  Under `Platforms` click `Add Platform` and select Web.  `Allow Implicit Flow` should be checked and set `http://localhost:3000` as the redirect URL.  You don't need a client secret since the explorer is a single page application.
* Rename `secrets.sample.js` to `secrets.js` in the project root and insert your client ID.


## Other commands
* `npm test` to run tests from the command line for scenarios like parsing metadata and functional explorer tests.
* `node .\bundleLocFiles.js` combines all the loc files in `translation_files/` to `scripts/loc_strings.ts`
* `npm run build:prod` to build the minified explorer for production use.
